# MP3-Fragmentation
The program, which will be invoked as defrag will have to traverse through a directory tree looking for pieces of an mp3, each piece's filename would be made up of an non-negative integer and the file-extension '.mp3' The file contents of those pieces should be concatenated into an output file in the order the numbers imply.
